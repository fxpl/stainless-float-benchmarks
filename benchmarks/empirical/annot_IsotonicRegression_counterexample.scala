   * @return Predicted label.
   *         1) If testData exactly matches a boundary then associated prediction is returned.
   *           In case there are multiple predictions with the same boundary then one of them
   *           is returned. Which one is undefined (same as java.util.Arrays.binarySearch).
   *         2) If testData is lower or higher than all boundaries then first or last prediction
   *           is returned respectively. In case there are multiple predictions with the same
   *           boundary then the lowest or highest is returned respectively.
   *         3) If testData falls between two values in boundary array then prediction is treated
   *           as piecewise linear function and interpolated value is returned. In case there are
   *           multiple values with the same boundary then the same rules as in 2) are used.
